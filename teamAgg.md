Though we do not have a Team Agreement md file, We have identified the answers for this submission.

We will work alongside each other at normal hours 6:30-9:30 like regularly scheduled class, and if available throughout the day as well.

If any conflicts come up we will address them as a team and handle them as a team.

As far as workload management we will utilize the peer-programming method of work, and if needed we will come together to discuss and address any hiccups in the development of the webpage. Everyone has to pull their weight if this project is to succeed and everyone in the group knows this.

The project and all elements in its creation will live on Github.

CodeX Team 615 is the organization we created to take on this assignment and will be how we share the repository with one another.

Everyone will participate in reviewing code and if any merge conflicts occur both peer teams will discuss what to keep and delete to resolve the conflict and merge as a result. Lastly, as a group we will come together when it is time to merge and will keep each member notified of any impending A-C-P so that everyone has an up-to-date branch locally so that there's no confusion.
